# Tensorflow_VID_Video_Object_Tracking

This Repository is my Master Thesis Project: "Develop a Video Object Detection with Tensorflow Technology" 
and it's still developing, so many updates will be made.
In this work, I used the architecture and problem solving strategy of the Paper T-CNN(), that won last year IMAGENET 2015 () Teaser Challenge VID ().
My project use many online tensorflow projects, as: 
  - YOLO Tensorflow (https://github.com/gliese581gg/YOLO_tensorflow);
  - TensorBox (https://github.com/Russell91/TensorBox).
